# ScaleSpace Indexing Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses optimizing the octave and subdivision array generation in the ScaleSpace constructor by replacing nested loops with more efficient and elegant Julia array operations using `repelem` and `repeat`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Replace nested loops with array operations

**User Story:** As a developer using the ScaleSpace library, I want the octave and subdivision array generation to use efficient Julia array operations so that the code is more readable and potentially faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN constructing a ScaleSpace THEN the system SHALL use `repelem` to generate the octaves array
2. WHEN constructing a ScaleSpace THEN the system SHALL use `repeat` to generate the subdivisions array  
3. WHEN using the new array operations THEN the system SHALL produce identical results to the current nested loop approach
4. WHEN using the new implementation THEN the octave-major ordering SHALL be preserved: (o0,s0), (o0,s1), (o0,s2), (o1,s0), (o1,s1), (o1,s2), ...

### Requirement 2: Maintain backward compatibility

**User Story:** As a user of the existing ScaleSpace API, I want all existing functionality to work unchanged so that my code doesn't break.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the optimized implementation THEN all existing indexing operations SHALL work identically
2. WHEN accessing levels via `ss[octave, subdivision]` THEN the system SHALL return the same results as before
3. WHEN iterating through levels THEN the order SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN using any existing ScaleSpace methods THEN they SHALL work without modification

### Requirement 3: Improve code readability

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the ScaleSpace code, I want the array generation to be more concise and idiomatic Julia so that the code is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the constructor code THEN the octave/subdivision generation SHALL be expressed in 1-2 lines instead of nested loops
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the intent SHALL be clearer through use of standard Julia array operations
3. WHEN documenting the code THEN the array generation approach SHALL be self-explanatory

### Requirement 4: Verify performance characteristics

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want to ensure the optimization doesn't negatively impact performance so that my applications remain fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmarking the new implementation THEN it SHALL perform at least as well as the current approach
2. WHEN constructing large ScaleSpaces THEN memory allocation SHALL not increase significantly
3. WHEN profiling the constructor THEN the array generation SHALL not become a bottleneck
