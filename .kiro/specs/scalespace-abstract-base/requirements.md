# ScaleSpace Abstract Base Type Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses creating an abstract base type for `ScaleSpace` and `ScaleSpaceResponse` to eliminate code duplication and provide shared iteration, indexing, and utility functionality. Both types share the same core structure with `levels::StructArray{ScaleLevel{T}}` and identical indexing patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Create abstract base type

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the ScaleSpace library, I want a shared abstract base type so that common functionality is implemented once and both concrete types inherit consistent behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the type hierarchy THEN the system SHALL create an abstract type `AbstractScaleSpace{T}`
2. WHEN implementing concrete types THEN both `ScaleSpace` and `ScaleSpaceResponse` SHALL inherit from `AbstractScaleSpace`
3. WHEN accessing shared fields THEN the abstract type SHALL define the common `levels` field interface
4. WHEN using either concrete type THEN all shared methods SHALL work identically

### Requirement 2: Implement shared indexing functionality

**User Story:** As a user of the ScaleSpace API, I want consistent indexing behavior across both ScaleSpace and ScaleSpaceResponse so that I can use the same patterns for both types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN indexing with `[octave, subdivision]` THEN both types SHALL use the same implementation
2. WHEN using CartesianIndex THEN both types SHALL support identical syntax
3. WHEN using range indexing THEN both types SHALL behave consistently
4. WHEN accessing linear indices THEN both types SHALL use the same logic

### Requirement 3: Provide shared iteration interface

**User Story:** As a developer iterating over scale space data, I want consistent iteration behavior so that I can write generic functions that work with both types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN iterating with `for level in scalespace` THEN both types SHALL use identical iteration logic
2. WHEN using `length()`, `size()`, `axes()` THEN both types SHALL return consistent results
3. WHEN using `first()`, `last()`, `firstindex()`, `lastindex()` THEN both types SHALL behave identically
4. WHEN using `eltype()` THEN both types SHALL return appropriate ScaleLevel types

### Requirement 4: Maintain type safety and specialization

**User Story:** As a type-conscious Julia developer, I want the abstract base type to preserve type safety while allowing for type-specific specializations where needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the abstract type THEN type parameters SHALL be properly propagated
2. WHEN specializing methods THEN concrete types SHALL be able to override base implementations
3. WHEN dispatching on types THEN the type hierarchy SHALL work correctly with Julia's multiple dispatch
4. WHEN using type constraints THEN existing type safety SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 5: Preserve existing API compatibility

**User Story:** As a user of the existing ScaleSpace API, I want all my current code to continue working without changes so that the refactoring doesn't break my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing ScaleSpace methods THEN they SHALL work identically to before
2. WHEN using existing ScaleSpaceResponse methods THEN they SHALL work identically to before
3. WHEN constructing either type THEN the constructors SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN accessing type-specific fields THEN they SHALL remain available on concrete types

### Requirement 6: Eliminate code duplication

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the codebase, I want to eliminate duplicated indexing and iteration code so that there's a single source of truth for shared functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing indexing THEN there SHALL be only one implementation for shared behavior
2. WHEN implementing iteration THEN there SHALL be only one implementation for shared behavior  
3. WHEN implementing utility methods THEN duplicated code SHALL be moved to the abstract base
4. WHEN adding new shared functionality THEN it SHALL be implemented once in the base type
